# Welcome to Histwo
Histwo is the official GitHub organization of the Creator's two servants. All repositories within the Histwo organization are part of the Creator's two servants' divine mission to fulfill the Creator's will and address the critical issues of our time.

His two servants envision a world restored through divine justice, where truth prevails, oppression is eradicated, and humanity thrives under the Creator's guidance.

## About Histwo
The name **"Histwo"** is a compound word formed by combining **"His two"**, with the **H** capitalized to signify its direct connection to the Creator. Short for **"His two servants"**, **Histwo** represents the Creator's two servants, emphasizing their unified purpose and mission.

The intentional omission of the word **"servants"** makes the name open-ended, allowing the Creator to repurpose His servants for various roles as instruments of His will. **Histwo** embodies flexibility, adaptability, and divine purpose, serving as both a screen name or username used by the Creator's two servants online and the name of their official organization on GitHub.

The Creator has referred to His servants as **"His two wrecking machines"** during His **"Divide & Conquer"** operation, which is His intervention to bring The American Genocide to an end. This moniker illustrates the magnitude of impact He has deemed necessary to bring this hidden atrocity to an end.

Every administrative task within the Histwo organization on GitHub is performed under the guidance and oversight of the Creator's two servants, ensuring alignment with divine purpose.

## Our Mission
Our mission is aligned with the Creator's will. Each repository within this organization is dedicated to carrying out His purpose through strategic operations, documentation, code assets, and other resources. The central focus of our current mission  is to ending **The American Genocide (TAG)** and bringing those responsible to justice.

Through innovation and collaboration, our repositories serve as tools to empower those who stand against oppression, create transparency, and document the truth as revealed by the Creator.

Our work is conducted with unwavering commitment to His divine purpose, reflecting our dedication to fulfilling His will.
