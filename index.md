# Welcome to Histwo
**Histwo.github.io** is the current official website of the Creator's two servants. This platform is dedicated to documenting and executing divine interventions, restoring balance, and addressing injustices, including **The American Genocide (TAG)**.

## Who Is the Creator?  
The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. We, His two servants, neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.

## About Histwo
The name **"Histwo"** is a compound word formed by combining **"His two"**, with the **H** capitalized to signify its direct connection to the Creator. Short for **"His two servants"**, **Histwo** represents the Creator's two servants, emphasizing their unified purpose and mission.  

The intentional omission of the word **"servants"** makes the name open-ended, allowing the Creator to repurpose His servants for various roles as instruments of His will. **Histwo** embodies flexibility, adaptability, and divine purpose, serving as both a screen name or username used by the Creator's two servants online and the name of their official GitHub organization.  

The Creator has referred to His servants as **"His two wrecking machines"** during His **["Divide & Conquer"](DC.md)** operation, which is His intervention to stop The American Genocide. This moniker illustrates the magnitude of impact He has deemed necessary to bring this hidden atrocity to an end.

## Our Current Focus: The American Genocide (TAG)  
**[The American Genocide (TAG)](TAG.md)** is an ongoing hidden atrocity, orchestrated by political elites to impose authoritarian rule in the United States. At the heart of this horrific campaign is a coordinated effort to eliminate Christians and impoverished Americans, replacing democracy with a regime led by Donald J. Trump.

### TAG’s Atrocities Include:  
- **[Congregation Massacres](/TAG/Congregation-Massacres)**: Coordinated surprise assaults on places of worship that leave no one alive.
- **[Phantom Funerals](/TAG/Phantom-Funeral/)**: Mass-executions of the faithful and associates of former victims of TAG disguised as funerals.
- **[Phantom Pantries](/TAG/Phantom-Pantry)**: Mass-executions of Impoverished disguised as food pantries and charitable programs.

### The Creator’s Divide & Conquer  
The Creator’s intervention into TAG is known as **Divide & Conquer**:  

### Our Mission
Histwo's mission is to serve the Creator by:
- Liberating the oppressed.
- Exposing the orchestrators and orchestrations of **TAG**.
- Documenting divine interventions for truth and justice.
