December 21, 2024 - The Creator says both President Joe 
Biden and President-elect Donald J. Trump are at the Welcome House, 234 Memorial Drive SW, Atlanta, Georgia, overseeing renewed attempts to kill one of the Creator’s two servants residing there. The operation is cloaked in secrecy, with Biden, Trump, and their Secret Service teams utilizing advanced microwave cloaking technology to remain nearly undetectable to the naked eye.

Earlier on Saturday morning, between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m., Trump reportedly spent several hours at the Red Roof Inn on North Druid Hills Road, where multiple attempts to kill His servant were made. His servant had been lured to the hotel under the guise of socializing with a new acquaintance and their "friends," later identified by the Creator as Secret Service agents. Despite the efforts, the Creator’s servant remains unharmed and unconcerned, though admittedly annoyed. Both leaders continue to collaborate in this escalating situation.
