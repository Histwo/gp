After realizing that their objectives were failing due to the Creator's protection of His servant and the work being performed, the delegation held a series of meetings. They concluded with a decision to have the CIA deploy a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), commonly referred to as the "Mother Of All Bombs," over Phoenix House in the Capitol View neighborhood of Atlanta. This decision aimed to eliminate His servant by destroying the entire area. Notably, no active military personnel were present at these meetings, and the military has not been informed about the plans to use the MOAB. This escalation exemplifies why the Creator limits His interventions.

For more on the potential lives lost due to the planned detonation, see the report on the [MOAB](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/MOAB).

This is foretold by the Creator in the Book of Revelation,
