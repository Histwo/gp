U.S. President-Elect Donald J. Trump secretly returned to Atlanta late on Friday night, November 29, 2024, and went to the Welcome House to oversee continued efforts by both the current and incoming administrations to eliminate one or both of the Creator's servants and to obtain the access device containing credentials for updating the StopTAG organization's repositories on GitHub. This visit follows his recent trips on November 12 and 26. One of the Creator's servants, who remains unharmed and unconcerned for his safety, was relocated to the Welcome House at 234 Memorial Drive by the CIA after an earlier attempt on November 18, during which one perpetrator was killed by another inside His servant's apartment. The Creator's servant continues to reside at the Welcome House as of this writing, securely retaining possession of the access device and expressing no concern for its safety or the safety of His servants.
