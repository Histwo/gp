January 2, 2025 - President-elect Donald Trump has re-joined his transition team in Atlanta, where they continue orchestrating efforts to target one of the Creator's two servants. Their objectives include attempts on His servantâ€™s life and seizing a critical access device used to update StopTAG, along with other key evidence in His servant's possession.

Since December 27, Trump and his team have orchestrated three social encounters aimed at achieving these goals but have failed in every attempt. The Creator and His servant remain steadfast and unconcerned.
