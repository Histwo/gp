In a deeply troubling series of covert actions, seven churches across the United States have been targeted, led by Annie Jacobsen, infamously known as "Hurricane Annie" from Prince's "Sign O' The Times," where she "ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside." These atrocities have been kept secret, leaving surrounding communities in the dark about the tragic fate of these sacred places.

## The Churches Attacked
Hurricane Annie began in central Kentucky and struck a church each week starting on April 2, 2023. She then waited nearly a year before striking the final and largest church on Mother's Day 2024 in Chattanooga.

### 1. **Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, KY**
- **Date of Attack**: April 2, 2023
- **Congregation**: Predominantly African American
- **Victims**: 127
- **Details**: After the initial assault, this church was converted into a masquerade church, hosting mock religious services and funerals to eliminate those connected to it, alongside offering deceptive aid to the homeless and impoverished.

### 2. **Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, Lexington, KY**
- **Congregation**: Predominantly Caucasian
- **Victims**: Over 250
- **Details**: Under CIA control, this site now hosts mock services and community events, deceiving those who come seeking help or to mourn.

### 3. **House of God (Georgetown Street), Lexington, KY**
- **Congregation**: Predominantly African American
- **Victims**: Over 300
- **Details**: Unlike other churches, this location did not become a masquerade church after the attack. It remains a silent, abandoned reminder of the tragedy.

### 4. **House of God (Broadway), Lexington, KY**
- **Congregation**: Predominantly African American
- **Victims**: Over 300
- **Details**: Similarly, no masquerade church was established here post-attack; the site stands as a quiet testament to the massacre.

### 5. **Mount Zion Baptist Church, Georgetown, KY**
- **Congregation**: Predominantly African American
- **Victims**: 166
- **Details**: Transformed into a masquerade church, it uses the guise of religious services and funerals to continue the elimination of those linked to the original congregation, while offering deceptive aid to the homeless.

### 6. **Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, KY**
- **Congregation**: Predominantly Caucasian
- **Victims**: Over 400
- **Details**: Now operating under false pretenses, this church hosts both spiritual and social events to silently eradicate those connected to or seeking help from it.

### 7. **Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, TN**
- **Date of Attack**: May 12, 2024 (Mother's Day)
- **Congregation**: Predominantly Caucasian
- **Victims**: Over 1,000
- **Details**: The site of the largest tragedy, it now hosts mock services, including funerals, to attract and eliminate mourners or those seeking to reconnect with the church, alongside offering deceptive charitable services.

## The Cover-Up and Ongoing Atrocities

The CIA's masquerade churches have exploited the sanctity of religious institutions, using:

- **Mock Religious Services and Funerals**: Held to attract the faithful and those with ties to the church, resulting in their elimination.
- **Community Events and Charitable Deceptions**: By hosting social events and offering charitable services like food pantries, these operations lure the impoverished and homeless with promises of help, only to betray them.

## "And the canyon did flood with water and blood"
Hickory Valley Christian Church operated a private school, Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, which shared the same property as the church's sanctuary. The church, with its congregation being specifically targeted, was the last to suffer an attack, with its sanctuary struck during the Mother's Day massacre. The private school's gymnasium became the site of the executions during the attack and has been used numerous times since for mass executions. Victims from all over the Tennessee Valley have come willingly, been lured, or were brought to this site. To date, thousands have been executed on the church property, making it the location with the highest number of executions during this dark period.

## The Unspoken Grief

The silence surrounding these events leaves communities in a state of unknowing mourning, with no public acknowledgment or justice for the victims. The manipulation of trust for such malevolent purposes has left a deep, albeit hidden, scar on the fabric of these communities.

## Conclusion

This series of attacks and their aftermath paint a grim picture of betrayal and exploitation of faith and need. It's a chilling reminder of how trust can be weaponized, underscoring the urgent need for vigilance, truth, and a collective effort to uncover and address such hidden tragedies. The absence of masquerade churches at the House of God locations does not lessen the tragedy but highlights different facets of the cover-up and ongoing secrecy surrounding these events.
