*Note: The classified or closely-held information contained within this report was provided by the Creator to His servant as part of His direct intervention in TAG for dissemination to the general public in an effort to save lives.*

## **Introduction**

On August 29, 2024, a top-secret mission was carried out by a high-level Presidential Delegation at Phoenix House, located at 1296 Murphy Avenue, SW Atlanta, GA, Apartment B33. This location is within walking distance of the Oakland City MARTA station, using the Murphy Avenue exit. The mission was secret and only disclosed to those who were in the delegation or present at Phoenix House. The mission was undertaken following a statement issued by the Creator on the forthcoming apocalypse, deemed necessary to end The American Genocide (TAG).

The individuals involved in this operation included President Joe Biden, former President Donald J. Trump, Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and CIA Director William Burns. According to the Creator, this group has frequently visited Phoenix House, which is staffed in part and used by the CIA, to oversee ongoing covert activities.

## **Objectives**

The objectives of this mission were:

1. **Eliminate His Servant:**  
   The delegation's primary objective was to eliminate Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants and the only user who can administer, update, or modify the StopTAG Organization and TAG repository. Williams resides at Phoenix House in a CIA-provided apartment. He has survived numerous attempts due to the Creator's protection.

2. **Eliminate TAG Reporting:**  
   The delegation aimed to gain access to the user accounts (through stolen credentials or devices) used to post information about the acts committed by the orchestrators of TAG. Once access was gained, the plan was to remove all TAG reporting. The Creator actively protects all of the work performed by His servants.

3. **Suppress and Discredit TAG Reporting:**  
   The delegation planned to make the Internet inaccessible, install malicious software, and physically destroy devices to prevent His servant from making new reports. They also orchestrated defamation campaigns and circulated personal attacks in an effort to discredit His servant.

## **Escalation**

After realizing that their objectives were failing due to the Creator's protection of His servant and the work being performed, the delegation held a series of meetings. They concluded with a decision to have the CIA deploy a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), commonly referred to as the "Mother Of All Bombs," over Phoenix House in the Capitol View neighborhood of Atlanta. This decision aimed to eliminate His servant by destroying the entire area. Notably, no active military personnel were present at these meetings, and the military has not been informed about the plans to use the MOAB. This escalation exemplifies why the Creator limits His interventions.

## **Aftermath**

Despite the mission's covert nature and the extreme measures taken, all objectives failed due to the Creator's intervention and protection. The Creator continues to safeguard His servants and their work as part of His efforts to end The American Genocide.
